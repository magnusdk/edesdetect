* TODOs

Explain what "end-to-end" means in background. Why does it matter? why not create features by hand?

Include this in background: ML is the study and development of algorithms that can learn from experience. If given enough examples, ML can approximate any mapping between input and output data \cite{zhang_dive_2020}.

Explain RNN GRU in background.


Describe that there are different views to be imaged in background. Mention apical-4-chamber specifically.




TODO: Mention the deadly triad in Q-learning with function approximators.
TODO: Write about why we chose DQN, what alternatives we considered, etc.

*** TODO Discussion
 Under the hood, the DQN algorithm is solving a regression problem. Given a state, the model predicts the expected future returns after taking a given action. 




 TODO: BCE is using RL for a job that asks for Supervised Learning. There is no exploration, but we still use exploration mechanisms like greedy-epsilon. Using epsilon of 1.0 (100% random decisions while training) is a sign that something is off. It is like an inefficient supervised learning training loop.
 - How is this similar to regular supervised learning classification problem?
   - DQN predicts expected future returns of taking an action. We can set up a supervised learning regression problem that predicts the same thing
 - We use epsilon=1 and discount=0 â€” implications?
 - Write about how DQN is simply a regression problem
 - Future work could be using Policy Gradient methods

** TODO Discussion

TODO: Also show example of frames from video of good video and bad video with corresponding q-values.

TODO: What does the in-the-middle spikes represent in the gaafd_best_videos_q plot?

TODO: Plot the best/worst videos as per each model's performance. Now each column is the same video, selected as the best for one of the models.


(TODO: GaaFD, what does it mean that the blue curve has lower loss than the dark-blue/purple one?)


TODO: Explain how ES performance is better than ED performance. Hypothesis: systole phase is shorter therefore mistakes are closer to ES on average.

TODO: Explain how (for $\epsilon=0.1$) GaaFD is higher (worse) than both the GaaFD for only ED and only ES. It's because when we filter out events sometimes there are no events to predict.

TODO: Discuss GaaFD-density plots




** Simulation experiment
Describe this under methodology
TODO: Here we run simulation of model with increasing accuracy and see what the GaaFD variance and mean look like. It's not perfect smiulation since we only increase accuracy, not "GaaFD"-accuracy.

TODO: Fix all plots that names $R_1$ or $R_2$.

* Scratch


* TODO From meeting [9/12]
- [ ] Results should summarize the research (this is important)
- [ ] Add units to axes where it is hard to know what's going on
- [ ] Fix LaTeX tables
- [X] Move all plots to results
- [X] R1 and R2 not clear what they are.
- [X] Don't mention that libraries are from Deepmind (irrelevant)
- [X] f.ex -> f.e or a.e
- [X] What is a density plot (methodology)
- [X] Increase graphics width
- [X] Include abstract (with conclusions)
- [X] Remove borders around links
- [X] Discussion: Why reinforcement learning? Did it make sense in the end?






We can use \clearpage to force figures to render at specific points.
