Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year \cite{noauthor_cardiovascular_nodate}. It is important to make a timely diagnosis so that patients may receive early treatment or for risk factor management. One standard tool used for diagnosis is cardiac imaging; non-invasive imaging of the heart.

In order to obtain images of the heart, clinicians use tools such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, or ultrasound. MRI and CT are not routinely used due to being expensive, having limited availability and a prolonged acquisition time, and using radiation for CT scans. Furthermore, both MRI and CT scans can not be performed if the patient has any metal in their body, such as a pacemaker or metal implants. Ultrasound, on the other hand, is cheap and flexible. There even exists handheld devices that can be carried by hand and brought on-site. Ultrasound does have a lower imaging quality compared to, for example, MRI \cite{mordi_efficacy_2017}, and the images can be difficult to interpret due to ultrasound-specific artifacts. Despite this, it is still preferable in many cases because of the aforementioned reasons.

Many heart measurements depend on two key events in the cardiac cycle: End-Diastole (ED) and End-Systole (ES). Roughly speaking, ED is when the heart is the most relaxed, and ES is when it is the most contracted. Left ventricular ejection fraction is an example of an important measurement that is calculated using ED and ES.

There are multiple ways of finding the ED and ES frames in a cardiac cycle \cite{mada_razvan_o_how_2015}:
1. Finding the frame with the maximum left ventricle volume (for ED) and the frame with the minimum left ventricle volume (for ES).
2. Finding the first frame following the closure of the mitral valve (for ED) and the first frame following the closure of the aortic valve (for ES).
3. Analyzing a simultaneously acquired Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.

Out of these three, using the ECG signal is the least preferable. This is because the methods for detecting the ED and ES frame may become unreliable when given an unconventional ECG signal, such as from patients with cardiomyopathy or regional wall motion abnormalities \cite{mada_razvan_o_how_2015}. Acquiring an ECG signal also requires applying electrodes to the patient, which is not ideal in emergency settings.

The other two methods, examining the aortic valve closure and finding the frame of maximum and minimum left ventricle volume, are both visual tasks and can be very time-consuming and laborious if done manually. A recent study has reported that the average time taken for manually annotating ED and ES frames from a video of 1 to 3 heartbeats is 26 seconds, with a standard deviation of $\pm 11$ seconds \cite{lane_multibeat_2021}. Furthermore, because there is not much movement around these frames, the predicted ED and ES frames may differ between different operators. It may even differ for the same operator predicting on the same video at different times. For these reasons automating ED/ES frame detection is desirable because it reduces time and creates a more robust and deterministic result.

The goal of this Masterâ€™s project is to explore the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for automatically detecting the ED and ES frames from an ultrasound video. RL is able to outperform humans in complex tasks, such as mastering the board game Go in 2016 \cite{silver_mastering_2016} or becoming among the 0.2% best players in the world in the video game Starcraft II \cite{vinyals_grandmaster_2019}. However, RL can do more than just play games, and many medical imaging applications also show promising potential \cite{zhou_deep_2021}. Some of these applications and their methods are discussed in later sections, but first, we focus our attention on previous attempts at detecting ED and ES frames.
