* Run locally
1. Create a file called =config_local.toml=.
2. Fill in local configuration values. See an example in the following subsection.
3. Install dependencies via pipenv: =pipenv install=.

** Local configuration example
This example contains all the needed values:
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[data]
videos_path = "/some/dirs/data/EchoNet-Dynamic/Videos/"
filelist_path = "/some/dirs/data/EchoNet-Dynamic/FileList.csv"
volumetracings_path = "/some/dirs/data/EchoNet-Dynamic/VolumeTracings.csv"
#+END_SRC

* Run on UiO's Ml-nodes
To run the code on UiO's Ml-nodes you need [[https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/kompetansehuber/uio-ai-hub-node-project/it-resources/ml-nodes/index.html#toc3][access to them]].

** Open project remotely in VSCode
Because UiO's Ml-nodes uses the =lmod= modules system and the required python version (3.8) isn't loaded by default we have to add a hack to make it work.
1. Create an SSH-key on the local machine.
2. Add the public SSH-key of the local machine to the remote machine's =.ssh/authorized_keys=. This step also removes the need to type your password on every connect! :)
3. Prepend the added =authorized_keys= row such that it looks like this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  command=". /path/to/repo/edesdetect/scripts/ssh_load_python3.8_on_start.sh" ssh-ed25519 ...rest of SSH public key...
  #+END_SRC
4. Verify that you can still log in to the remote server using SSH. Once logged in you should see Python3.8 being loaded (as well some other modules) if you type =module list=.
5. [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial][Install the =Remote - SSH= VSCode extension]] and follow the steps in the tutorial.

** Run Jupyter-Lab
Run this command to start a Jupyter Lab server and an SSH tunnel that let's you connect to it locally:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 USERNAME@ML_NODE -t "cd path/to/edesdetect; ./scripts/start_jupyter_lab_server.sh"
#+END_SRC
